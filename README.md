# React Rating - Fast MUI Replacement

### Made by [Siddhant Madhur](https://siddhantsoftware.com)

#### Issue:

When I was using MaterialUI's Rating component it was, alone, adding 25kb to my JavaScript bundle size. This Component is meant to replace it, with eventual, feature parity.

#### TODO:

* [X] Change state passed to it
* [X] Allow any number of stars/icons
* [ ] Allow any number of divisions
* [ ] Allow custom SVG's
